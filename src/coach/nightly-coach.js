// The nightly coach: one Claude call with the coaching rules (CLAUDE.md, from
// import-plan), the active block and six weeks of data. Per the coach rules spec
// (docs/coach-rules.md) the rules engine makes the decisions; Claude explains
// them. It returns, as checked structured output:
//   - the day's note for the dashboard (including any end-of-block review),
//   - a review (status + comment) for each run day that has passed unreviewed.
// Run reviews go through src/plan/store.js, logged as "nightly-coach".
