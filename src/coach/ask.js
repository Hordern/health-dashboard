// "Ask" chats on the dashboard: Daniel talks to his running coach, his lifting
// coach or a GP-style health adviser about anything in his data. Each persona
// starts with a snapshot of the last couple of weeks and has read-only tools for
// the full detail (every run's laps/zones/metrics, every set of every session,
// health history, SQL). Daniel can attach screenshots. Nothing here changes the
// plan; plan changes go through the planning chat, the rules engine or the
// connector. Chats are stored in coach_chats with topic = the persona.
